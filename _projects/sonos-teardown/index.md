title: Systems Engineering Project 1
description: For this project, my team created and constructed a physical arena for the AgileX LIMO mobile robot as part of a robotics systems engineering project. The environment was designed for the LIMO robot to perform tasks such as navigation, path planning, mapping, and localization. Additionally, understanding how the robot interacts with its environment, handling design trade-offs under time and financial constraints, and cooperating as a team were all necessary factors for this project. Hence, the final result would reflect reliable testing of SLAM and obstacle avoidance of the arena.
