title: Systems Engineering Project 1
description: For this project, my team created and constructed a physical arena for the AgileX LIMO mobile robot as part of a robotics systems engineering project. The environment was designed for the LIMO robot to perform tasks such as navigation, path planning, mapping, and localization. Additionally, understanding how the robot interacts with its environment, handling design trade-offs under time and financial constraints, and cooperating as a team were all necessary factors for this project. Hence, the final result would reflect reliable testing of SLAM and obstacle avoidance of the arena.<br><br> **Arena Design** <br> Before the actual implementation of the robot autonomous navigation, the arena had to be created. Our team's arena design was a collaborative and interative process which began with the survey of Changi Airport Terminal 1 to gather perspective of distinct landmarks such as the arrival/departure halls and Kinetic rain. With these references, we created an initial 3D layout on SolidWorks to model the arena layout. After which, our team reviewed and refined our design based on space constraint and material limitations. Key modifications included removing ramps to to simplify the making of the arena and focused on scalable elemnents like walls, flooring and decorative structures. Our team team then sourced materials such as foam board for the flooring and walls, clay for the Kinetic Rain Droplets (practical to build and aestheically accurate) and spray paint for finishing. Through trial aand error and feedbacks, the final arena design managed to capture the essernce of Changi Airport Terminal while also following the technical requirements of AgileX LIMO robot's navigation. <br><br> **Implementing Systems Approach** <br> Our team applied Systems Approach from SEBok to guide the designing of the arena and overall the project execution. First off, we began with problem identification which involved identifying constraints like space limitations and material availability. For solution synthesis, we explored possible solutions to mitigate this problem for example, segmenting the arena into modular components(Kinetic Rain, Wall) and allocated tasks based on members expertise. Doing trade-off analysis such as choosing foam over pricier materias and excluding ramps from the arena for feasibility dictated our decisions. Verification was evident in SolidWorks design revision (v1.0 to v1.1) by contrasting it against stakeholders requirements and also validation involved testing the navigation in the physical arena. <br><br> **Robot Navigation** <br> From the available tools, our team decided to use RTAB navigation over Gmapping and cartographer as our arena and other teams layout were much complicated and required more detailed scanning and mapping of obtacles. To implement the RTAB navigation with the LIMO robot, we followed a workflow. Firstly we initialised the LIMO by launching **roslaunch limo_bringup limo_start.launch**, activated the Astra camera by **dabai_u3.launch** to capture depth data and followed by **limo_rtabmap_orbbec.launch** for SLAM. Lastly to visualise the mapping snf the robot pose in real time in RViz by launching **rtabmap_rviz.launch** . One advantage of using RTAB-mapping was that it eliminated the need of setting the robot initial pose because it auto localised using existing map database (from ~/.ros/rtabmap.db). With these, it enable us to have a accurate path planning and obstacle avoidance.
